	   WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that
	   utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster,
	    simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the
	   massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
	   than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
	   running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
	   many different circumstances.

	   requires:
	    CONFIG_NET for basic networking support
	    CONFIG_INET for basic IP support
	    CONFIG_NET_UDP_TUNNEL for sending and receiving UDP packets
	    CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK for determining the source address when constructing ICMP packets
	    CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_HASHLIMIT for ratelimiting when under DoS attacks
	    CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES only if using CONFIG_IPV6 for ratelimiting when under DoS attacks
	    CONFIG_CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER for doing scatter-gather I/O
	    CONFIG_PADATA for parallel crypto, only available on multi-core machines
